    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <pre style="text-align: center;">
        Hello reader, I am an international student from India studying Game Programming at St.
Lawrence College. My background is in digital arts and animation, and since high school, I have 
been passionate about design. Video games are also one of my interests! Every day after school, 
when school was out for the summer, I used to spend all day playing video games on my NES. It 
is reasonable to say that video games have influenced my life over the years, and I still adore 
them just as much as I did when I was a child. So that's why I made the decision to turn my hobby 
into a career. I think my experience with gaming and design training will be a great help to me as I aspire to 
become a Game Programmer and Designer.
